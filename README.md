# Brock Bus
This is an archived bus arrival project built for Brock University. It shows currently arriving buses at the Brock Tower stop in St. Catharines, Ontario.

## About the project
This project was built using the St. Catharines transit API. While attending Brock as a student, I noticed a monitor next to the bus waiting area with information about arriving buses with text that was small and difficult to read from a distance. After speaking with those in charge of the monitor, I created and installed a new auto-updating display. Using Brock branding, it was complimented by a number of students and staff.

The desk is no more, as it was destroyed during construction of a new lobby, but the archived version can be found running on my kubernetes cluster [here](https://brockbus.ryder.rocks).
